# List of horrifying messages from things.

## "Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages"
This comes from apt on Debian/Ubuntu and can happen for any number of obscure reasons that are hard or impossible to fix. And the worst part is the error implies it's your own fault.

## "Error, refusing to lose untracked file at"
This comes from git. You very nearly destroyed data in your working copy and git saved you.

## Sending a sensitive file over netcat, mistyping the IP, and having the connection succeed anyway.
