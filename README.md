Links and notes to resources I've found helpful and that are either too specific or too broad to find again through Google.

Using a flat list with hashtags until some structure emerges.

I only put things here that I've at least read or used and found useful. So it's somewhat curated.

Mixing python subprocess and python thread can lead to deadlocks if two threads fork a subprocess at the same time. Affects cpython 2.x and maybe others. See https://bugs.python.org/issue2320  #python
